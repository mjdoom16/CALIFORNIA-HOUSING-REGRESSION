After exploring the California Housing dataset provided by sklearn, key features were found before using a variety of supervised learning tasks to identify the best model. Then hyperparameter optimization to find the optimum hyperparameter value. The predicted vs actual (& residuals) targets were then plotted to see performance of the model.
